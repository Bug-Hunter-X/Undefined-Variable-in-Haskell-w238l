# Haskell Undefined Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell: using an undefined variable. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to perform an operation on a variable (`x`) that has not been assigned a value.  This leads to a runtime exception. The solution involves properly initializing the variable before use.
